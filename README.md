# School_District_Analysis

## Background and Overview

After conducting an in-depth analysis of a school district, the council-board has identified altered data and has requested in conjunction with Maria to redo that analysis by eliminating the reading and math degrees of 9th grade students. This new analysis will share information by executing the following:

- The district summary DataFrame 
- The school summary DataFrame 
- The top 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate 
- The bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate 
- The average math score for each grade level from each school 
- The average reading score for each grade level from each school 
- The scores by school spending per student 
- The scores by school size 
- The scores by school type 

## Results
